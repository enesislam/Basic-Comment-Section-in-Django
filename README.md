# Basic-Comment-Section-in-Django
This is the final of my hardest work for 2 month.
I know, maybe this is a long time for just a comment section.
But believe me I got too much error for this. As well as Automatically Comment Author .
I was write a view but this allows to the user that user can explain any name in 'comment author name'.
But this was anonymously. 
I think these files are enough for the burn the light :)
Have Fun!
