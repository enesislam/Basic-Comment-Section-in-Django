# django_comment_section_Example_for_any_project
This is the final of my hardest work for 2 month.
I know, maybe for you this is a long time for just a comment section.
But believe me i got too much error for this. As well for Author authentication for comment writer.
I was write a view but this allows to the user that user can explain any name in 'comment author name'.
But this was anonymously. 
I think these files are enough for the lamp to light :)
Have Fun!
